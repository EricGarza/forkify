# forkify
Forkify project from Udemy course The Complete JavaScript Course
<br />
<br />

The main reason I took this course was to gain a better understanding of how to create a JavaScript project with no other libraries or frameworks. This project had me create a simple recipe search app that allowed the user to type in a keyword (e.g. Pizza) and in return the app would provide recipes that contained that keyword. The implementation of the project consisted of adding event listeners to html and css elements through the Document api and writing JavaScript functions to carry out those events.

If you wish to clone the repo and run the application for yourself, go to the application directory and run the following command
<br />
`npm run start`
<br />
Then go to localhost:8080 and you should be greeted by the homepage.
